# fileScope
an xy scope for audio files stored on your computer.

change which file is being scoped by changing the filepath on line 99.

change the size of the scope by adjusting the zoom values on lines 23 and 24. This will probably need to be adjusted on a per-file basis, depending on the characteristics of the particular file being scoped.

change the pace of randomized color changing by adjusting the value of "delta" on line 43.
